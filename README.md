### Built with

### What I learned

Throught this project, I learnt to center an icon in a button together with the test. The hover color (for the button) was not given in the exercise) so, I had to figure that out myself.
I was able to solve the icon alignment with this css properties

```css
button {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
